# CursorLocker
Cursor Locker is a simple tool for Windows that allows users to lock the cursor to any open window. This is mostly useful for games in multi-monitor setups if the game itself does not restrict mouse movement.

Usage:
- Select a window from the list or focus it and press the Active window shortcut (default: F4).
- Press the lock toggle shortcut (default: F9) to lock/unlock the mouse to a selected window.
